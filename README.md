# Firefighter-Vs-Bugs
Firefighter Vs Bugs was made for the Warm & Fuzzy & Fun & Stupid (KIFASS 3) Game Jam: https://itch.io/jam/kifass-3

It was heavily inspired by the old Nokia game Panda Vs Bugs.

In Fireman Vs Bugs, our fighter’s greatest shame has been revealed: he’s a big baby who’s terrified of bugs. How long can you keep your dignity? That is... after all the farting.

Press Down to kill the bugs, and Arrow keys to maneuver.
